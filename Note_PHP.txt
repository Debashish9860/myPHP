================
1. Downloaded the new ci4 Project from the link https://www.codeigniter.com/download.
2. I started the WAMP server.
3. I moved the index.php and .htacess from the public folder to the root directory.
4. I changed the end file name to .env
5. Uncommented the CI_ENVIRONMENT = production to CI_ENVIRONMENT = development
6. Added a code for the auto route in the Routes.php ($routes->setAutoRoute(true);)
7. Changed the require FCPATH . '../app/Config/Paths.php'; to require FCPATH . 'app/Config/Paths.php';

Following step is very easy and clear to add the existing folder to the newly created repository and to show the same
in the GitHub Desktop ---->
A.  Open the command prompt with the Project which you created and then ->
    1.  C:\wamp64\www\myPHP>git init
    2.  C:\wamp64\www\myPHP>git add .
    3.  C:\wamp64\www\myPHP>git commit -m "Fresh CI4 Setup"
    4.  C:\wamp64\www\myPHP>git remote add origin https://github.com/Debashish9860/myPHP.git
    5.  C:\wamp64\www\myPHP>git push -u origin master
B.  Now to open the repository in the GitHub Desktop ->
    1.  Add -> Existing Repository -> Put the local path of the Project
    2.  Then you can see everything.
